I am Newton-Mosharafa PhD student/Scholar at [University of Aberdeen](https://www.abdn.ac.uk/people/m.tawfik.19) (Aberdeen, Scotland, UK) in the Scottish Fish Immunology Research Centre, College of Life Sciences and Medicine. My supervisors are [Prof Sam Martin](https://www.abdn.ac.uk/people/sam.martin/) and [Prof Alex Douglas](https://www.abdn.ac.uk/people/a.douglas/). My research is currently focussed on how we can increase acceptance and utlisation of vegetable diets in Atlantic salmon by applying nutritional programming strategy. Investigating the underlying mechanisms by robust analysing of gut microbiome and transcriptome was carried out. I have also worked as a demonstrator on a number of courses ranging from biostatistics and bioinformatics to biodiversity courses.

I got my Bachelor degree in Veterinary Medical Sciences from the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Zagazig University in 2010. I received my Postgraduate Diploma in Nanotechnology and Masters in Fish Health from Beni-Suef University and Cairo University respectively in 2017. I joined the Scottish Fish Immunology Research Centre at the University of Aberdeen in 2019 for pursuing my PhD studies using -omics technology to tackle sustainbaility issues in aquaculture. I investigated nutritional programming via investigating 16s rRNA marker gene sequencing to help understand the underlying nutritional programming mechanisms. My main interest extended to studying the molecular crosstalk between the gut and the immune systems in response to certain diets. Before joining the Scottish Fish Immunology Research Centre, I was appointed as an Assistant Researcher at the National Research Centre, Egypt in 2017.

Some of the grants I got at early stage that helped me in advancing my data science/bioinformatics skills are Million-Arab Coders "Data Analyst Track"; Alghurair Open Learning Program; Egypt Scholars Lab Program "Integrative -omics/Interactome Track" and Coursera Financial Aid for some "Genomics courses". I had got several funding offers (6-month Egyptian Ministry of Higher Education Visiting Fellowship in USA, 6-month Erasmus Postgraduate Fellowship in Spain, and Misr El-Kheir Qualifying Program Scholarship in Egypt) before going for/settling down on Newton-Mosharafa PhD Scholarship in UK (Egypt-UK bilateral agreement).

During my PhD, I managed to have an online facilitated dialogue experience via the Erasmus Virtual Exchange program with various cultures/backgrounds fellows where I received Erasmus+ badge. I achieved the second-best poster (overall) presented at the 20th (Zebra)Fish Immunology/Vaccination Workshop.  Public speaking is one of the activities I enjoy that is why I was a contestant in several Science Communication festivals particularly Famelab where I joined three times so far.
