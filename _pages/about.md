I am a PhD candidate at [University of Aberdeen](https://www.abdn.ac.uk/people/m.tawfik.19) (Aberdeen, Scotland, UK) in the Scottish Fish Immunology Research Centre, College of Life Sciences and Medicine. My supervisors are [Prof Sam Martin](https://www.abdn.ac.uk/people/sam.martin/) and [Prof Alex Douglas](https://www.abdn.ac.uk/people/a.douglas/).

My research is currently focussed on how we can increase acceptance and utlisation of vegetable diets in Atlantic salmon and investigating the underlying mechanisms by robust analysing of gut microbiome and transcriptome. I have also worked as a demonstrator on a number of courses ranging from biostatistics and bioinformatics to biodiversity courses.
